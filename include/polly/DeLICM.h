/// Compute the reaching definition statement for each definition of an array

///
/// The reaching definition of an array element at a specific timepoint is the
/// statement instance that had written the current element's content. This
/// function computes all reaching definitions for all array elements and
/// timepoints. For example:
///
/// Schedule := { Write[] -> [0]; Overwrite[] -> [10] }
/// Defs := { Write[] -> A[5]; Overwrite[] -> A[5] }
///
/// That is, index 5 of array A will be written to at timepoint 0 and 10. The
/// result will be:
///
/// { [A[5] -> [i]] -> Write[] : 0 < i < 10;
///   [A[5] -> [i]] -> Overwrite[] : 10 < i }
///
/// That is, between timepoint 0 (Write[]) and timepoint 10 (Overwrite[]), the
/// content of A[5] was written by statement instance Write[] and after
/// timepoint 10 by Overwrite[]. Values not defined in the map have no known
/// definition. This includes the statement instance timepoints themselves,
/// because reads at those timepoints could either read the old or the new
/// value, defined only by the statement itself. But this can be changed by @p
/// InclDef and @p InclRedef. InclDef=false and InclRedef=true will return a
/// zone. Unless @p InclDef and @p InclRedef are both true, there is only one
/// unique definition per element and timepoint.
///
/// @param Schedule  { DomainWrite[] -> Scatter[] }
